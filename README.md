# If you have a low PC, do this:
### 1. Try updating your computer and freeing up space.

### 2. Run our games on the lowest graphics (low/bad).

### 3. Clean up game storage on Steam or Epic Games by uninstalling other games.

### 4. Move the "Saved" folder from the game's directory onto another folder (Desktop or Local Disk (D:), new folder (recommended: Other)).
